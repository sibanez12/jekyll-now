# About Me

I recently completed my PhD at Stanford University advised by Professor [Nick McKeown](http://yuba.stanford.edu/~nickm/) and am currently a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford.
Prior to my PhD, I received my bachelors degree in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College.

I am passionate about building high performance network systems by leveraging hardware/software co-design.
I am currently working on [the nanoPU]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/nanoPU-arxiv.pdf), a novel CPU-NIC architecture designed to provide ultra low latency and high throughput.
The nanoPU moves the entire network stack into line-rate hardware: programmable transport, core selection, and thread scheduling.
It uses a novel register file network interface rather than the traditional DMA-based network interface in order to provide the lowest possible latency and most predictable performance.
We developed an [open source](https://github.com/l-nic/chipyard/wiki), end-to-end FPGA prototype that runs on AWS F1 instances using [Firesim](https://fires.im/).
The wire-to-wire latency through the nanoPU is just 69ns â€“ an order of magnitude lower latency than state-of-the-art commercial NICs!
The nanoPU also enables single-digit microsecond 99% tail latencies and message processing throughput of over 100 Mrps per-core.
You can learn more about the nanoPU from our [paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/nanoPU-arxiv.pdf) and this [30min talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu_nx5gLfmY&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=OpenNetworkingFoundation).
